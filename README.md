mermaid
=======

Generation of diagram and flowchart from text in a similar manner as markdown.

Ever wanted to simplify documentation and avoid heavy tools like visio when explaining your code?

This is why I came up with mermaid, a simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via javascript.

`A --> B

A --> C

B-->D

C-->D`
