        <h1 id="how-to-contribute">How to contribute</h1>
<p>Great that you want to be involved in this project! Contributing is fun and contributions are GREAT! :)</p>
<p>This page is currently a starting point is not so rigorous to start with.</p>
<p>Some important guidlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The work will be organized using the issues list<ul>
<li>In the list there will be the bugs/enhancements etc we are working with in the project</li>
<li>There will be milestones outlineing the roadmap ahead</li>
<li>There will issues marked with help wanted</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue list and the items marked with <strong>help wanted</strong> is a good starting point if you want to do some work.</p>
<h2 id="guidelines-for-avoiding-duplicate-work">Guidelines for avoiding duplicate work</h2>
<p>Contributing is great. It is not so fun when you are done with your issue and just before you&#39;re about to push your
change you cant because someone else just pushed the same fix so you have wasted your time. The guidelines below are in
place to prevent this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comment in the issue that you are working on it. You will then be added as an assignee (eventually).</li>
<li>When you pick an issue to work on.<ul>
<li>Check that the issue not assigned</li>
<li>Also check the comments so that no one has started working on it before beeing officially assigned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submitting-changes">Submitting changes</h2>
<p>Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you&#39;ve done (read more about pull requests). When you send
a pull request, we will love you forever if you include jasmine tests. We can always use more test coverage.</p>
<p>Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:</p>
<p>$ git commit -m &quot;A brief summary of the commit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A paragraph describing what changed and its impact.&quot;
Coding conventions
Start reading our code and you&#39;ll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It&#39;s sort of
like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you&#39;re alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as
smooth as possible.</p>
<p>So that we can consistently serve images from the CDN, always use image_path or image_tag when referring to images.
Never prepend &quot;/images/&quot; when using image_path or image_tag.
Also for the CDN, always use cwd-relative paths rather than root-relative paths in image URLs in any CSS. So instead of
url(&#39;/images/blah.gif&#39;), use url(&#39;../images/blah.gif&#39;).</p>
<h3 id="build-instructions">Build instructions</h3>
<p>Fork, then:</p>
<pre>npm install</pre><p>Then the dependencies will have been installed. You use gulp as build tool.</p>
<p>The following targets are probably interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>jison - compiles the jison grammars to parser files</li>
<li>jasmine - runs the jasmine tests (will trigger the jison target)</li>
<li>dist - complies files to the dist catalog</li>
</ul>
<p>for instance:</p>
<pre>gulp jasmine</pre><p>Thanks, Knut Sveidqvist</p>
